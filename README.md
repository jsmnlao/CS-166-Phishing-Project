# CS-166-Phishing-Project

## Approaches

The proposed approach to completing this project is to build the cloned webpage, create an official looking email address, write an official concerning looking email, and send out the phishing attack. 

We will be using Github and Git commands to create a collaborative environment for all of us to contribute to the project. For the system environment, we will be using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java for the application languages. We will also be using JDBC and MySQL for storing the stolen information and attempting login from the given information. 

To send out the phishing attack, we will be cloning the SJSU login page (tentative).

## Deliverables 

The deliverables for this project are the cloned website files, the file containing stolen usernames and passwords, and an image of the spam email.

The cloned website files are the HTML and CSS files that mimic the actual website. The HTML file should contain code to take the user’s username and password, store them in a file on our end, and then redirect the user to the actual website’s login page. 

The file containing stolen usernames and passwords proves that the user’s information was successfully stolen. Since the “victims” are already aware of the project ahead of time, these usernames and passwords would be fake credentials, in order to prevent anyone’s actual username and password from being stolen.

The spam email would urge the recipient to log into their account by clicking on our phishing link. It would be designed to look as official as possible, in order to mimic actual phishing emails that attempt to steal user information.
